    "\n",
    "Letting “R” denote a rainy day and “T” denote a not rainy day, we first notice there are four states we move between: RR, RT, TR, RR. We assign a number to each state: RR=0, RT=1, TR=2, TT=3. We start the process in state 0 as it rained yesterday and today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we want to set up a transition array where the i,jth entry is the probability of moving from state i to state j in one transition. These values P[i, j] are given in the statement of the problem. Notice the scenario that it rains “one of the days” must be broken up into two states TR and RT. If we are in state TR, and it rains tomorrow, we move to RR. But if we are in state RT and it rains tomorrow, we move to state TR."
